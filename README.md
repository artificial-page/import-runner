# üëü Import runner

Dynamically import and run functions (even on client side!)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Install

```bash
npm install import-runner
```

## üèÉ Run

```typescript
import run from "import-runner"

(async () => {
  await run({
    cwd: __dirname,
    each: [
      { path: "thisFunction" },
      { path: "thatFunction" },
      {
        all: [
          { path: "otherFunction" },
          { path: "andAnotherFunction" },
        ]
      }
    ],
  })
})()
```

| Option | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `cwd` | Working directory to find functions |
| `each` | Execute functions in succession (one after the other) |
| `all` | Execute functions concurrently (all at once) |

## ‚õ∑Ô∏è More options

```typescript
import run from "import-runner"

(async () => {
  const memo = await run({
    cwd: __dirname,
    arg: {},
    memo: true,
    each: [
      { path: "thisFunction" },
      { path: "thatFunction" }
    ],
    skip: ({ path }) => path === "thatFunction",
  })
})()
```

| Option | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `arg` | Argument to pass into functions (object or array only in `memo` mode) |
| `memo` | Memoize function output (`arg` is the starting value) |
| `skip` | Custom function skip condition |

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Options may exist at any depth, and apply to all child functions unless overwritten.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Child `arg` options are merged if they are similar types and `memo: true`.

## Client side

When running in the browser, import runner automatically adds `.mjs` extensions to your path.

You'll likely still need to change the `cwd` option on the client to point to your assets directory.
